# Video-Recording-React-Native-Expo  
Personal thing  
Adding progress here https://snack.expo.dev/@johnnyclay/github.com-imrohit007-video-recording-react-native-expo  
Currently trying to command it through Python Webocket  
 - Works on the web version, but fails to connect on mobile, once that happens we are good
Made tempherokuapp repo and domain for testing API
