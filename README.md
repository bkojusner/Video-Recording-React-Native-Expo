# Video-Recording-React-Native-Expo  
Personal thing  
Adding progress here https://snack.expo.dev/@johnnyclay/github.com-imrohit007-video-recording-react-native-expo  
Currently trying to command it through Python Webocket  
Works, deployed on Heroku

Remaining tasks:
1. Send command to record for x amount of time
2. Have the server work with the computer
3. Have the computer respond to the server
4. Actually have a way to save the files after the recording
